India’s renewable energy (RE) sector is world’s 4th most attractive RE market. Why?

Globally, cost to generate Solar Energy dropped by 90% & Wind Energy costs by 70% in past 10 years
Costs almost at par with natural gas!
Global investments in RE : $282 Bn in 2019
45% coming from China, who aims to get 62% energy via Renewable Energy in next 3 years.
By 2040, India aims to generate ~49% of total electricity from Renewable Energy
Past 9 months slowed domestic solar installations by 80% in comparison to 2019.
World’s top 5 oil companies made ~$900 Bn in profits in past 10 years. RE is already grabbing a bite of this quickly doubling ‘energy need’ pie.
Reliance and Adani Green are also scaling efforts.
Stock of Adani Green Energy up 25x in 1.5 years!
RIL aims to be net carbon zero by 2035.
•Global Funds grabbing bites of India’s RE assets:
1) KKR launches Virescent for RE investments
2) EQT and Temasek set up O2 Power, a $500Mn RE platform
3) Other players actively involved include Goldman Sachs, Brookfield, SoftBank, CPPIB, JERA, GIC.
ReNew Power, Warburg Pincus backed CleanMax and Morgan Stanley owned Continuum Wind Energy, few key RE Indian players aiming for IPOs soon
Do you think India can execute with speed to achieve targets in next 10 years or will it be a bumpy ride?
